28506627,['DPB1*09:01'],RXRB Is an MHC-Encoded Susceptibility Gene Associated with Anti-Topoisomerase I Antibody-Positive Systemic Sclerosis.,"Systemic sclerosis is a systemic autoimmune and connective tissue disorder associated with the human leukocyte antigen locus. However, the functional relationship between human leukocyte antigen gene(s) and disease development remains unknown. To elucidate major histocompatibility complex-linked systemic sclerosis genetics, we performed genotyping of major histocompatibility complex-borne microsatellites and HLA-DPB1 alleles using DNA obtained from 318 anti-topoisomerase I antibody-positive patients and 561 healthy controls, all of Japanese descent. Those results revealed two major histocompatibility complex haplotypes associated with systemic sclerosis. Exome sequencing and targeted analysis of these risk haplotypes identified rs17847931 in RXRB as a susceptibility variant (P = 1.3 × 10<sup>-15</sup>; odds ratio [OR] = 9.4) with amino acid substitution p.V95A on the risk haplotype harboring HLA-DPB1∗13:01. No identical variant in the other haplotype including DPB1*09:01 was observed, though that haplotype also showed a significant association (P = 8.5 × 10<sup>-22</sup>; OR = 4.3) with systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, the number of risk factors was shown to be a predominant factor, as individuals with two factors had elevated risk (P = 6.7 × 10<sup>-13</sup>; OR = 30.2). We concluded that RXRB may be involved in antifibrotic activity in skin and chromatin remodeling.",The Journal of investigative dermatology,"DictElement({'Volume': '137', 'Issue': '9', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})"
24498086,['DPB1*13:01'],Association of HLA-DPB1 with scleroderma and its clinical features in Chinese population.,"Human leukocyte antigen DPB1 was reported to contain singly nucleotide polymorphisms conferring the strongest susceptibility to systemic sclerosis in Korean population. However, associations of specific DPB1 alleles with SSc vary in different ethnic populations. The aim of this study was to profile DPB1 alleles in Chinese population and to identify specific DPB1 alleles in association with SSc and clinical and serological features of SSc in Han Chinese. A cohort containing 338 patients with SSc and 480 gender-matched and unrelated controls were examined in the study. The HLA-DPB1 genotyping was performed with sequence-based typing method. Exact p-values were obtained (Fisher's test) from 2×2 tables of allele counts or allele carriers and disease status. Thirty eight DPB1 alleles were found in the cohort. DPB1*05:01 was the most common allele in this cohort. DPB1*03:01 and *13:01 were significantly increased in SSc. DPB1*13:01 association had already been described in other ethnic populations, whereas DPB1*03:01 was specific to Han Chinese patients with SSc. In addition, comparisons between SSc subsets indicated that patients carrying DPB1*03:01 were more likely to develop pulmonary fibrosis, DPB1*04 carriers were increased in SSc patients with anti-centromere autoantibodies and in contrast, SSc patients with homozygous DPB1*05:01 showed an opposite association with marginal significance.

31810856,['DPB1*17:01'],Fine mapping of the MHC region identifies major independent variants associated with Han Chinese primary biliary cholangitis.,"The genetic association of primary biliary cholangitis with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been widely confirmed among different ethnicities. To map specific MHC region variants associated with PBC in a Han Chinese cohort, we imputed HLA antigens and amino acids (AA) in 1126 PBC cases and 1770 healthy control subjects using a Han-MHC reference database. We demonstrate that HLA-DRB1 and/or HLA-DQB1 contributed the strongest signals, and that HLA-DPB1 was a separate independent locus. Regression analyses with classical HLA alleles indicate that HLA-DQB1*03:01 or HLA-DQβ1-Pro55, HLA-DPB1*17:01 or HLA-DPβ1-Asp84 and HLA-DRB1*08:03 could largely explain MHC association with PBC. Forward stepwise regression analyses with HLA amino acid variants localize the major signals to HLA-DRβ1-Ala74, HLA-DQβ1-Pro55 and HLA-DPβ1-Asp84. Electrostatic potential calculations implicated AA variations at HLA-DQβ1 position 55 and HLA-DPβ1 position 84 as critical to peptide binding properties. Furthermore, although several critical Han Chinese AA variants differed from those shown in European populations, the predicted effects on antigen binding are likely to be very similar or identical and underlie the major component of MHC association with PBC.",Journal of autoimmunity,"DictElement({'Volume': '107', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})"
29348432,['DQB1*03:03'],Genome-wide association study of self-reported food reactions in Japanese identifies shrimp and peach specific loci in the HLA-DR/DQ gene region.,"Food allergy is an increasingly important health problem in the world. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on European ancestry samples have identified food allergy-specific loci in the HLA class II region. We conducted GWAS of self-reported reactivity with common foods using the data from 11011 Japanese women and identified shrimp and peach allergy-specific loci in the HLA-DR/DQ gene region tagged by rs74995702 (P = 6.30 × 10<sup>-17</sup>, OR = 1.91) and rs28359884 (P = 2.3 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, OR = 1.80), respectively. After HLA imputation using a Japanese population-specific reference, the most strongly associated haplotype was HLA-DRB1*04:05-HLA-DQB1*04:01 for shrimp allergy (P = 3.92 × 10<sup>-19</sup>, OR = 1.99) and HLA-DRB1*09:01-HLA-DQB1*03:03 for peach allergy (P = 1.15 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, OR = 1.68). Additionally, both allergies' associated variants were eQTLs for several HLA genes, with HLA-DQA2 the single eQTL gene shared between the two traits. Our study suggests that allergy to certain foods may be related to genetic differences that tag both HLA alleles having particular epitope binding specificities as well as variants modulating expression of particular HLA genes. Investigating this further could increase our understanding of food allergy aetiology and potentially lead to better therapeutic strategies for allergen immunotherapies.",Scientific reports,"DictElement({'Volume': '8', 'Issue': '1', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2018', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '18'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})"
27166610,"['DQB1*03:03', 'DRB1*13:02']",Protective Role of HLA-DRB1*13:02 against Microscopic Polyangiitis and MPO-ANCA-Positive Vasculitides in a Japanese Population: A Case-Control Study.,"Among antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and proteinase 3-ANCA-positive AAV (PR3-AAV) are prevalent in European populations, while microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive AAV (MPO-AAV) are predominant in the Japanese. We previously demonstrated association of DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03 haplotype, a haplotype common in East Asians but rare in the European populations, with MPA/MPO-AAV, suggesting that a population difference in HLA-class II plays a role in the epidemiology of this disease. To gain further insights, we increased the sample size and performed an extended association study of DRB1 and DPB1 with AAV subsets in 468 Japanese patients with AAV classified according to the European Medicines Agency algorithm (MPA: 285, GPA: 92, eosinophilic GPA [EGPA]: 56, unclassifiable: 35) and 596 healthy controls. Among these patients, 377 were positive for MPO-ANCA and 62 for PR3-ANCA. The significance level was set at α = 3.3x10-4 by applying Bonferroni correction. The association of DRB1*09:01 with MPO-AAV was confirmed (allele model, P = 2.1x10-4, odds ratio [OR] = 1.57). Protective association of DRB1*13:02 was detected against MPO-AAV (allele model, P = 2.3x10-5, OR = 0.42) and MPA (dominant model, P = 2.7x10-4, OR = 0.43). A trend toward increased frequency of DPB1*04:01, the risk allele for GPA in European populations, was observed among Japanese patients with PR3-AAV when conditioned on DRB1*13:02 (Padjusted = 0.0021, ORadjusted = 3.48). In contrast, the frequency of DPB1*04:01 was decreased among Japanese patients with MPO-AAV, and this effect lost significance when conditioned on DRB1*13:02 (Padjusted = 0.16), suggesting that DRB1*13:02 or other allele(s) in linkage disequilibrium may be responsible for the protection. The differential association of DPB1*04:01 with PR3-AAV and MPO-AAV and difference in DPB1*04:01 allele frequencies between populations supported the hypothesis that the HLA-class II population difference may account in part for these epidemiologic characteristics. Furthermore, taken together with our previous observations, the haplotype carrying DRB1*13:02 was suggested to be a shared protective factor against multiple autoimmune diseases.",PloS one,"DictElement({'Volume': '11', 'Issue': '5', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2016'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})"
29313220,['DQB1*05:03'],"Pemphigus: a Comprehensive Review on Pathogenesis, Clinical Presentation and Novel Therapeutic Approaches.","Pemphigus is a group of rare, potentially devastating autoimmune diseases of the skin and mucous membranes with high morbidity and potentially lethal outcome. The major clinical variant, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is caused by a loss of intercellular adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes which is induced by IgG autoantibodies against components of desmosomes. Specifically, IgG against the desmosomal adhesion proteins, desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) and desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), preferentially target their ectodomains which are presumably critical for the transinteraction and signalling function of these adhesion molecules. There is a close immunogenetic association of PV with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, HLA-DRB1*04:02 and HLA-DQB1*05:03. These have been shown to be critical for the presentation of immunodominant peptides to autoreactive CD4+ T helper cells. The importance of autoaggressive T-B cell interaction in the induction of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies which directly cause epidermal loss of adhesion has been demonstrated both clinically (by the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab) and experimentally (in PV mouse models). The strong association of clinically active pemphigus with autoantibodies of the IgG<sub>4</sub> and IgE subclasses strongly suggests that T helper 2 cells are critical regulators of the immune pathogenesis of pemphigus. Novel therapeutic approaches target autoreactive T and B cells to specifically interfere with the T cell-dependent activation of B cells leading to the generation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells. Our improved understanding of the autoantibody-driven effector phase of pemphigus has led to the introduction of novel therapies that target pathogenic autoantibodies such as immunoadsorption and drugs that block pathogenic autoantibody-induced cell signalling events.",Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,"DictElement({'Volume': '54', 'Issue': '1', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2018', 'Month': 'Feb'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})"

Although there is strong evidence of inheritance, the genetic causes of this disease are not well understood. Previously, a large-scale genome-wide association study described an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1 and asthma; the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between HLA-DQB1 and PA. Genotypic and allelic profiles were established for 311 Caucasian members of a well-described Canadian group of children with PA and 226 Caucasian controls.

32253422,['DRB1*11:01'],HLA loci predisposing to immune TTP in Japanese: potential role of the shared ADAMTS13 peptide bound to different HLA-DR.,"Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a rare autoimmune disorder caused by neutralizing anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. In white individuals, HLA allele DRB1*11 is a predisposing factor for iTTP, whereas DRB1*04 is a protective factor. However, the role of HLA in Asians is unclear. In this study, we analyzed 10 HLA loci using next-generation sequencing in 52 Japanese patients with iTTP, and the allele frequency in the iTTP group was compared with that in a Japanese control group. We identified the following HLA alleles as predisposing factors for iTTP in the Japanese population: DRB1*08:03 (odds ratio [OR], 3.06; corrected P [Pc] = .005), DRB3/4/5*blank (OR, 2.3; Pc = .007), DQA1*01:03 (OR, 2.25; Pc = .006), and DQB1*06:01 (OR,: 2.41; Pc = .003). The estimated haplotype consisting of these 4 alleles was significantly more frequent in the iTTP group than in the control group (30.8% vs 6.0%; Pc < .001). DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01 were weak protective factors for iTTP (OR, 0.23; Pc = .076; and OR, 0.23, Pc = .034, respectively). On the other hand, DRB1*11 and DRB1*04 were not associated with iTTP in the Japanese. These findings indicated that predisposing and protective factors for iTTP differ between Japanese and white individuals.

HLA-DRB1 alleles have previously been associated with ABPA-CF susceptibility; however, HLA-DQB1 allele associations have not been clearly established. The aim of the present study was to investigate HLA class II associations in patients with ABPA-CF and determine their roles in susceptibility or protection. Patients with ABPA-CF, patients with CF without ABPA, patients with asthma without ABPA (AST), and healthy controls were included in this study. DNA was extracted by automatic extractor. HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 genotyping was performed by the Luminex PCR-SSOP method (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA). Allele specific PCR-SSP was also performed by high-resolution analysis (One Lambda). Statistical analysis was performed with SSPS and Arlequin software. Both HLA-DRB1*5:01 and -DRB1*11:04 alleles occurred with greater frequency in patients with ABPA-CF than in those with AST and CF and control subjects, corroborating previously published data. On the other hand, analysis of haplotypes revealed that almost all patients with ABPA-CF lacking DRB1*15:01 or DRB1*11:04 carry either DRB1*04, DRB1*11:01, or DRB1*07:01 alleles. In the HLA-DQB1 region, the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele occurred more frequently in patients with ABPA-CF than in those with AST and CF and healthy controls, whereas HLA-DQB1*02:01 occurred less frequently in patients with ABPA-CF.

In this review, we summarize the genetic risk factors for AIH, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on European AIH revealed the strongest associations to be with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in HLA.

Other risk SNVs in non-HLA genes for AIH were found by a candidate gene approach, but several SNVs were confirmed in replication studies. Some genetic factors of AIH overlapped with those of other autoimmune diseases. Larger-scale GWASs of other ethnic groups are required.

Since only a small proportion of individuals exposed to HP-related antigens develop the disease, a genetic predisposition is largely suspected. However, studies regarding genetic susceptibility in this disease are scanty. We have previously found evidence supporting increased risk associated to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in sporadic HP. In the present study, we conducted a family-based research that includes nine multicase families with at least two related HP patients (RHP). We evaluated 19 RHP individuals, 25 additional healthy first-degree relatives (REA) and 246 healthy unrelated individuals (HUI). HLA class II typing (DRB1/3/4/5, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, DPB1, DMA and DMB), and -863, -308 and -238 polymorphisms in the promoter region of TNF-α were performed by PCR based methods.

The predisposing alleles are variable among ethnic groups and/or diseases. On the other hand, some HLA alleles are associated with resistance to systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, DRB1*13 alleles are the protective alleles shared by multiple autoimmune diseases. DRB1*13:01 allele is protective in European populations and DRB1*13:02 in Japanese. Because alleles in multiple HLA loci are in strong linkage disequilibrium, it is difficult to determine which of the protective alleles is functionally responsible for the protective effects. Thus far, association studies suggested that DRB1*13:02 represents at least one of the causally associated protective factors against multiple systemic autoimmune diseases in the Japanese population. The protective effect of DRB1*13 alleles appears to overcome the predisposing effect of the susceptible alleles in heterozygous individuals of DRB1*13 and the susceptible allele. A gene dosage effect was observed in the associations of DRB1*13:02 with the protection from systemic autoimmune diseases; thus homozygous individuals are more effectively protected from the systemic autoimmune diseases than heterozygotes. DRB1*13:02 also confers protection against organ-specific autoimmune diseases and some infectious diseases. Several hypotheses can be proposed for the molecular mechanisms of the protection conferred by DRB1*13, some of which can explain the dominant effect of DRB1*13 molecules over the susceptible alleles, but the actual protective function of DRB1*13 requires further study.

HLA-G encodes two potentially functional polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region, 14bp insertion/deletion (14bp indel, rs371194629) and a single nucleotide polymorphism rs1063320, previously reported to affect HLA-G expression level or splicing isoform and to be associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the results of SLE association studies are inconsistent, probably due to the small sample size of each study and lack of consideration of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with HLA-class II haplotypes in each population. In this study, we performed association studies of these polymorphisms on 843 patients with SLE and 778 healthy controls in a Japanese population, in many of whom HLA-DRB1 alleles have been genotyped at the four-digit level. LD was detected between DRB1*13:02, protective against multiple autoimmune diseases in the Japanese, and the rs1063320 G (D' = 0.86, r2 = 0.02) and with 14bp del (D' = 0.62, r2 = 0.01), but not between SLE-susceptible DRB1*15:01 and HLA-G.

The DRB1*13:02 allele was found to be negatively associated with RA (P = 4.59×10(-10), corrected P (Pc) = 1.42×10(-8), odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.55, P [RPE] = 1.27×10(-6)); the genotypes DRB1*04:05/*13:02 and *09:01/*13:02 were also negatively associated with RA. The protective effect of *13:02 was also present in ACPA-positive patients (P = 3.95×10(-8), Pc = 1.22×10(-6), OR 0.42, 95%CI 0.31-0.58) whereas *15:02 was negatively associated only with ACPA-negative RA (P = 8.87×10(-5), Pc = 0.0026, OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.12-0.56). Thus, this study identified a negative association of DRB1*13:02 with Japanese RA; our findings support the protective role of DRB1*13:02 in the pathogenesis of ACPA-positive RA.",PloS one,"DictElement({'Volume': '9', 'Issue': '6', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2014'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})"
21545408,"['DRB1*13:02', 'DRB1*15:02']",A study of HLA class I and class II 4-digit allele level in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are represented by rare but life-threatening cutaneous adverse reactions to different drugs. Previous studies have found that in a Han Chinese population from Taiwan and other Asian Countries, a strong genetic association between HLA-class I alleles (B*15:02, B*58:01) and SJS and TEN was induced by carbamazepine and allopurinol, respectively. To identify genetic markers that covered the MHC region, we carried out a case-control association enrolling 20 Caucasian patients with SJS/TEN. Our patient series included 10 cases related to paracetamol, 7 to allopurinol and 3 to different drugs (plaquenil, itraconazol, nabumetone). Healthy controls were represented by 115 Caucasian bone marrow or stem cell donors. The HLA-A*, B*, C*, DRB1*, DQB1*, DQA1* and DPB1* genotyping were determined. The frequencies of HLA-A*33:03 as well as C*03:02 and C*08:01 were significantly higher in SJS/TEN patient subgroup showing allopurinol drug-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) as compared to controls (28.6% vs 0%, P=0.00002, Pc=0.0011; 28.6% vs 0%, P=0.00002, Pc=0.001; 28.6% vs 0%, P=0.00002, Pc=0.001, respectively). In the same subgroup the frequencies of B*58:01, DRB1*15:02 and DRB1*13:02 alleles, although considerably higher than in control group (42.8% vs 5.2%, P=0.003; 28.6% vs 1.7%, P=0.005; 28.6% vs 3.5%, P=0.037, respectively), appeared no more statistically different after P correction (Pc=0.248; Pc=0.29; Pc=1.00, respectively). In addition, in 10 of the 20 SJS/TEN patient subgroup with paracetamol-induced SCAR no statistically significant association with HLA alleles could be found. However, in the same SJS/TEN patient subgroup showing allopurinol drug-induced SCAR, haplotype analysis indicated that B*58:01, DRB1*13:02 and DRB1*15:02 alleles, that in a single allele analysis lost statistical significance after P correction, may still confer susceptibility, because the B*58:01-DRB1*13:02 and DRB1*15:02-DQB1*05:02 are positively associated with the disease (14.2% vs 0.43%, P= 0.00001, Pc=0.00028; 14.2% vs 0.43%, P=0.00001, Pc=0.00028, respectively). Our results show that in contrast to SCAR-related to paracetamol, where HLA alleles do not appear to be involved, HLA molecules behave as a strong risk factor for SCAR-related to allopurinol even when a limited number of patients are considered.",International journal of immunogenetics,"DictElement({'Volume': '38', 'Issue': '4', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2011', 'Month': 'Aug'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})"
