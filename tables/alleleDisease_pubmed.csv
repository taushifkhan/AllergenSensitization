However, higher EBA incidence and predisposing genetic factor(s) involving an HLA haplotype have been suspected in some populations. This retrospective study assessed the overrepresentation of black patients with EBA, its link with HLA-DRB1*15:03, and their clinical and immunological characteristics. Between 2005 and 2009, 7/13 (54%) EBA and 6/183 (3%) other-AIBD patients seen consecutively in our department were black (P=10(-6)); moreover 7/13 (54%) black patients and 6/183 (3%) white patients had EBA (P=10(-6)). In addition, between 1983 and 2005, 12 black patients had EBA. Finally, among the 19 black EBA patients, most of them had very atypical clinical presentations, 9 were natives of sub-Saharan Africa, 1 from Reunion Island, 7 from the West Indies, and 2 were of mixed ancestry. HLA-DRB1*15:03 allelic frequencies were 50% for African patients, significantly higher than the control population (P<10(-3)), and 21% for the West Indians (nonsignificant). High EBA frequencies have already been reported in American blacks significantly associated with the HLA-DR2. In conclusion, black-skinned patients developing EBA seem to have a genetic predisposition, and EBA should be suspected systematically for every AIBD seen in this population.",2011

In this study we examined the association between RA and the alleles of the six classical HLA loci including DRB1. Six HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1) of 1659 Japanese subjects (622 cases; 488 anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) antibody (Ab) positive (82.6%); 103 anti-CCP Ab negative (17.4%); 31 not known and 1037 controls) were genotyped. Disease types and positivity/negativity for CCP autoantibodies were used to stratify the cases. Statistical and genetic assessments were performed by Fisher's exact tests, odds ratio, trend tests and haplotype estimation. None of the HLA loci were significantly associated with CCP sero-negative cases after Bonferroni correction and we therefore limited further analyses to using only the anti CCP-positive RA cases and both anti-CCP positive and anti-CCP negative controls. Some alleles of the non-DRB1 HLA loci showed significant association with RA, which could be explained by linkage disequilibrium with DRB1 alleles. However, DPB1*02:01, DPB1*04:01 and DPB1*09:01 conferred RA risk/protection independently from DRB1. DPB1*02:01 was significantly associated with the highly erosive disease type. The odds ratio of the four HLA-loci haplotypes with DRB1*04:05 and DQB1*04:01, which were the high-risk HLA alleles in Japanese, varied from 1.01 to 5.58. C*07:04, and B*15:18 showed similar P-values and odds ratios to DRB1*04:01, which was located on the same haplotype. This haplotype analysis showed that the DRB1 gene as well as five other HLA loci is required for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic association between HLA and RA than analyzing DRB1 alone.",2012

HLA-DRB1 alleles have previously been associated with ABPA-CF susceptibility; however, HLA-DQB1 allele associations have not been clearly established. The aim of the present study was to investigate HLA class II associations in patients with ABPA-CF and determine their roles in susceptibility or protection. Patients with ABPA-CF, patients with CF without ABPA, patients with asthma without ABPA (AST), and healthy controls were included in this study. DNA was extracted by automatic extractor. HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 genotyping was performed by the Luminex PCR-SSOP method (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA). Allele specific PCR-SSP was also performed by high-resolution analysis (One Lambda). Statistical analysis was performed with SSPS and Arlequin software. Both HLA-DRB1*5:01 and -DRB1*11:04 alleles occurred with greater frequency in patients with ABPA-CF than in those with AST and CF and control subjects, corroborating previously published data. On the other hand, analysis of haplotypes revealed that almost all patients with ABPA-CF lacking DRB1*15:01 or DRB1*11:04 carry either DRB1*04, DRB1*11:01, or DRB1*07:01 alleles. In the HLA-DQB1 region, the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele occurred more frequently in patients with ABPA-CF than in those with AST and CF and healthy controls, whereas HLA-DQB1*02:01 occurred less frequently in patients with ABPA-CF. These data confirm that there is a correlation between HLA-DRB1*15:01, -DRB1*11:04, DRB1*11:01, -DRB1*04 and -DRB1*07:01 alleles and ABPA-CF susceptibility and suggest that HLA-DQB1*02:01 is an ABPA-CF resistance allele.",2013

All SSc patients met the ACR classification criteria for SSc. HLA-DR typing was performed using INNO-LiPA HLA-DRB Decoder kits (INNOGENETICS) and reconfirmed using MICRO SSP HLA DNA Typing kits (ONE LAMBDA). The allele frequency (AF) of HLA-DR*15, compared with HC, was significantly higher in all SSc patients (41.0 vs 21.7%, Pc = 0.0083) and SSc patients with anti-Scl70 antibody positive (anti-Scl70+) (47.1%, Pc = 0.0018).

DR0801 confers risk and shares a key feature with other HLA class II alleles that predispose to autoimmunity: a nonaspartic acid at beta57. DR1101 is associated with protection from PBC, and its sequence includes an aspartic acid at beta57. To elucidate a mechanism for the opposing effects of these HLA alleles on PBC susceptibility, we compared the features of epitopes presented by DR0801 and DR1101. First, we identified DR0801- and DR1101-restricted epitopes within multiple viral Ags, observing both shared and distinct epitopes. Because DR0801 is not well characterized, we deduced its motif by measuring binding affinities for a library of peptides, confirming its key features through structural modeling. DR0801 was distinct from DR1101 in its ability to accommodate charged residues within all but one of its binding pockets. In particular, DR0801 strongly preferred acidic residues in pocket 9. These findings were used to identify potentially antigenic sequences within PDC-E2 (an important hepatic autoantigen) that contain a DR0801 motif. Four peptides bound to DR0801 with reasonable affinity, but only one of these bound to DR1101. Three peptides, PDC-E2145-159, PDC-E2(249-263), and PDC-E2(629-643), elicited high-affinity T cell responses in DR0801 subjects, implicating these as likely autoreactive specificities. Therefore, the unique molecular features of DR0801 may lead to the selection of a distinct T cell repertoire that contributes to breakdown of self-tolerance in primary biliary cirrhosis, whereas those of DR1101 promote tolerance.",2013

We attempt to expand upon previous findings by genotyping more HLA genes and to replicate SNP associations by focusing on Japanese NOA patients. HLA typing of six genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, and -DPB1) was done on 355 NOA patients using SSO-Luminex assay while genotyping of two previously reported SNPs (rs498422 and rs3129878) was done on 443 patients and 544 fertile males using TaqMan assay.

We identified 28 rare alleles with frequencies of less than 1% in the Thai individuals. Ambiguity for HLA-DPB1*28:01 in exon 2 was resolved to DPB1*296:01 by next-generation sequencing of all exons. Multi-locus haplotypes including HLA class I and II loci were reported in this study. This is the first comprehensive report of allele and haplotype frequencies of all three HLA class II genes from a Thai population. A high-resolution genotyping method such as next-generation sequencing avoids missing rare alleles and resolves ambiguous calls. The HLA class II genotyping data generated in this study will be beneficial not only for future disease association/vaccine efficacy studies related to the RV144 study, but also for similar studies in other diseases in the Thai population, as well as population genetics and transplantation studies.

Specific alleles have been associated with differential responses to HIV-1 infection and disease among adults. This study aims to determine the influence of HLA class II genes and their interactive effect on mother-child perinatal transmission in a drug naïve, Mother-Child HIV transmission cohort established in Kenya, Africa in 1986. Our study showed that DRB concordance between mother and child increased risk of perinatal HIV transmission by three fold (P = 0.00035/Pc = 0.0014, OR: 3.09, 95%CI, 1.64-5.83). Whereas, DPA1, DPB1 and DQB1 concordance between mother and child had no significant influence on perinatal HIV transmission. In addition, stratified analysis showed that DRB1*15:03+ phenotype (mother or child) significantly increases the risk of perinatal HIV-1 transmission. Without DRB1*15:03, DRB1 discordance between mother and child provided 5 fold protection (P = 0.00008, OR: 0.186, 95%CI: 0.081-0.427). However, the protective effect of DRB discordance was diminished if either the mother or the child was DRB1*15:03+ phenotype (P = 0.49-0.98, OR: 0.7-0.99, 95%CI: 0.246-2.956). DRB3+ children were less likely to be infected perinatally (P = 0.0006, Pc = 0.014; OR:0.343, 95%CI:0.183-0.642). However, there is a 4 fold increase in risk of being infected at birth if DRB3+ children were born to DRB1*15:03+ mother compared to those with DRB1*15:03- mother. Our study showed that DRB concordance/discordance, DRB1*15:03, children's DRB3 phenotype and their interactions play an important role in perinatal HIV transmission. Identification of genetic factors associated with protection or increased risk in perinatal transmission will help develop alternative prevention and treatment methods in the event of increases in drug resistance of ARV.

Genetic variations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes may alter the efficiency of immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV) antigens and have been implicated in the risk of cervical cancer. We investigated whether polymorphisms in the HLA-DPB1 gene were associated with cervical cancer risk in a Taiwanese population. HLA-DPB1 alleles and +550 G/A polymorphism were genotyped in a case-control study of 473 women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and 676 healthy controls. The presence and genotypes of HPV in CSCC were determined. We found that the DPB1*05:01 and +550 A alleles were associated with decreased and increased risk of CSCC, respectively [odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, Pc = 0.001; OR = 1.25, Pc = 0.03].

A total of 133 patients with T1D were tested for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles using PCR-SSP compared to 100 ethnic-matched healthy controls. Alleles and haplotypes frequencies were compared between both groups. The most susceptible alleles for disease were HLA-DRB1*03:01, DRB1*04:02, DQB1*02:01 and DQB1*03:02, and protective alleles were HLA-DRB1*07:01, *11:01, *13:01, *14:01 and DRB1*15 and HLA-DQB1*06:01, *06:02 and *06:03.

We previously demonstrated association of DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03 haplotype, a haplotype common in East Asians but rare in the European populations, with MPA/MPO-AAV, suggesting that a population difference in HLA-class II plays a role in the epidemiology of this disease. To gain further insights, we increased the sample size and performed an extended association study of DRB1 and DPB1 with AAV subsets in 468 Japanese patients with AAV classified according to the European Medicines Agency algorithm (MPA: 285, GPA: 92, eosinophilic GPA [EGPA]: 56, unclassifiable: 35) and 596 healthy controls. Among these patients, 377 were positive for MPO-ANCA and 62 for PR3-ANCA. The significance level was set at α = 3.3x10-4 by applying Bonferroni correction. The association of DRB1*09:01 with MPO-AAV was confirmed (allele model, P = 2.1x10-4, odds ratio [OR] = 1.57). Protective association of DRB1*13:02 was detected against MPO-AAV (allele model, P = 2.3x10-5, OR = 0.42) and MPA (dominant model, P = 2.7x10-4, OR = 0.43). A trend toward increased frequency of DPB1*04:01, the risk allele for GPA in European populations, was observed among Japanese patients with PR3-AAV when conditioned on DRB1*13:02 (Padjusted = 0.0021, ORadjusted = 3.48). In contrast, the frequency of DPB1*04:01 was decreased among Japanese patients with MPO-AAV, and this effect lost significance when conditioned on DRB1*13:02 (Padjusted = 0.16), suggesting that DRB1*13:02 or other allele(s) in linkage disequilibrium may be responsible for the protection. The differential association of DPB1*04:01 with PR3-AAV and MPO-AAV and difference in DPB1*04:01 allele frequencies between populations supported the hypothesis that the HLA-class II population difference may account in part for these epidemiologic characteristics. Furthermore, taken together with our previous observations, the haplotype carrying DRB1*13:02 was suggested to be a shared protective factor against multiple autoimmune diseases.",2016

In this study, we analyzed 10 HLA loci using next-generation sequencing in 52 Japanese patients with iTTP, and the allele frequency in the iTTP group was compared with that in a Japanese control group. We identified the following HLA alleles as predisposing factors for iTTP in the Japanese population: DRB1*08:03 (odds ratio [OR], 3.06; corrected P [Pc] = .005), DRB3/4/5*blank (OR, 2.3; Pc = .007), DQA1*01:03 (OR, 2.25; Pc = .006), and DQB1*06:01 (OR,: 2.41; Pc = .003). The estimated haplotype consisting of these 4 alleles was significantly more frequent in the iTTP group than in the control group (30.8% vs 6.0%; Pc < .001). DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01 were weak protective factors for iTTP (OR, 0.23; Pc = .076; and OR, 0.23, Pc = .034, respectively). On the other hand, DRB1*11 and DRB1*04 were not associated with iTTP in the Japanese. These findings indicated that predisposing and protective factors for iTTP differ between Japanese and white individuals. HLA-DR molecules encoded by DRB1*08:03 and DRB1*11:01 have different peptide-binding motifs, but interestingly, bound to the shared ADAMTS13 peptide in an in silico prediction model.",2020

The aim of this study was to investigate the polymorphism of HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 alleles and haplotypes among BEN patients and to determine whether an association between HLA and BEN exists. In this study, we investigated HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 alleles and haplotypes in a population of patients with BEN (N = 111) and matched healthy controls (N = 190). All individuals were tested by PCR-SSO and PCR-SSP methods to assess the possible contribution of HLA alleles and haplotypes to the development of/protection from BEN. Our results showed a positive association between the presence of HLA-B*35:02 and DRB1*04:02 alleles and BEN (P = 0.0179 and P = 0.0151, respectively) in contrast to the protective effect of HLA-A*01:01, B*27:05 and B*57:01 alleles (P = 0.0111, P = 0.0330 and P = 0.0318, respectively).

While precise pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear, features characteristic of both autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases were reported. Data on immunotherapy are limited and its efficacy remains controversial. In this study we retrospectively investigated an anti-IgLON5 disease cohort with special focus on clinical, serological, and genetic predictors of the immunotherapy response and long-term outcome. Patients were recruited from the GENERATE (GErman NEtwork for REsearch on AuToimmune Encephalitis) registry. Along with clinical parameters, anti-IgLON5 immunoglobulin (Ig)G in serum and CSF, anti-IgLON5 IgG1-4, IgA, and IgM in serum, neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein in serum as well as human leukocyte antigen-genotypes were determined. We identified 53 patients (symptom onset 63.8 ± 10.3 years, female:male 1:1.5). The most frequent initial clinical presentations were bulbar syndrome, hyperkinetic syndrome or isolated sleep disorder (at least one symptom present in 38% [20/53]). At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients had a generalized multi-systemic phenotype; nevertheless 21% (11/53) still had an isolated brainstem syndrome and/or a characteristic sleep disorder only. About a third of patients (28% [15/53]) reported subacute disease onset and 51% (27/53) relapse-like exacerbations during the disease course. Inflammatory CSF changes were evident in 37% (19/51) and increased blood-CSF-barrier permeability in 46% (21/46). CSF cell count significantly decreased, while serum anti-IgLON5 IgG titer increased with disease duration. The presence of human leukocyte antigen-DRB1*10:01 (55% [24/44]) was associated with higher serum anti-IgLON5 IgG titers. Neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein in serum were substantially increased (71.1 ± 103.9 pg/ml and 126.7 ± 73.3 pg/ml, respectively). First-line immunotherapy of relapse-like acute-to-subacute exacerbation episodes resulted in improvement in 41% (11/27) of patients and early initiation within the first six weeks was a predictor for therapy response. Sixty-eight percent (36/53) of patients were treated with long-term immunotherapy and 75% (27/36) of these experienced no further disease progression (observation period of 20.2 ± 15.4 months). Long-term immunotherapy initiation during the first year after onset and low pre-treatment neurofilament light chain were significant predictors for a better outcome. In conclusion, subacute disease onset and early inflammatory CSF changes support the primary role of autoimmune mechanisms at least at initial stages of anti-IgLON5 disease. Early immunotherapy, prior to advanced neurodegeneration, is associated with a better long-term clinical outcome. Low serum neurofilament light chain at treatment initiation may serve as a potential biomarker of the immunotherapy response.",2022
