29348432,['DQB1*03:03'],Genome-wide association study of self-reported food reactions in Japanese identifies shrimp and peach specific loci in the HLA-DR/DQ gene region.,Scientific reports,"DictElement({'Volume': '8', 'Issue': '1', 'PubDate': {'Year': '2018', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '18'}}, attributes={'CitedMedium': 'Internet'})","Food allergy is an increasingly important health problem in the world. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on European ancestry samples have identified food allergy-specific loci in the HLA class II region. We conducted GWAS of self-reported reactivity with common foods using the data from 11011 Japanese women and identified shrimp and peach allergy-specific loci in the HLA-DR/DQ gene region tagged by rs74995702 (P = 6.30 × 10<sup>-17</sup>, OR = 1.91) and rs28359884 (P = 2.3 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, OR = 1.80), respectively. After HLA imputation using a Japanese population-specific reference, the most strongly associated haplotype was HLA-DRB1*04:05-HLA-DQB1*04:01 for shrimp allergy (P = 3.92 × 10<sup>-19</sup>, OR = 1.99) and HLA-DRB1*09:01-HLA-DQB1*03:03 for peach allergy (P = 1.15 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, OR = 1.68). Additionally, both allergies' associated variants were eQTLs for several HLA genes, with HLA-DQA2 the single eQTL gene shared between the two traits. Our study suggests that allergy to certain foods may be related to genetic differences that tag both HLA alleles having particular epitope binding specificities as well as variants modulating expression of particular HLA genes. Investigating this further could increase our understanding of food allergy aetiology and potentially lead to better therapeutic strategies for allergen immunotherapies.",2018

Canary Islanders have the largest African genetic ancestry observed among Southwestern Europeans and the highest asthma prevalence in Spain. Here we examined broad chromosomal regions previously associated with an excess of African genetic ancestry in Canary Islanders, with the aim of identifying novel risk variants associated with asthma susceptibility. In a two-stage cases-control study, we revealed a variant within HLA-DQB1 significantly associated with asthma risk (rs1049213, meta-analysis p = 1.30 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, OR [95% CI] = 1.74 [1.41-2.13]) previously associated with asthma and broad allergic phenotype. Subsequent fine-mapping analyses of classical HLA alleles revealed a novel allele significantly associated with asthma protection (HLA-DQA1*01:02, meta-analysis p = 3.98 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, OR [95% CI] = 0.64 [0.50-0.82]) that had been linked to infectious and autoimmune diseases, and peanut allergy. HLA haplotype analyses revealed a novel haplotype DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:04 conferring asthma protection (meta-analysis p = 4.71 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, OR [95% CI] = 0.47 [0.29- 0.73]).",2021

Previous studies have found that in a Han Chinese population from Taiwan and other Asian Countries, a strong genetic association between HLA-class I alleles (B*15:02, B*58:01) and SJS and TEN was induced by carbamazepine and allopurinol, respectively. To identify genetic markers that covered the MHC region, we carried out a case-control association enrolling 20 Caucasian patients with SJS/TEN. Our patient series included 10 cases related to paracetamol, 7 to allopurinol and 3 to different drugs (plaquenil, itraconazol, nabumetone). Healthy controls were represented by 115 Caucasian bone marrow or stem cell donors. The HLA-A*, B*, C*, DRB1*, DQB1*, DQA1* and DPB1* genotyping were determined. The frequencies of HLA-A*33:03 as well as C*03:02 and C*08:01 were significantly higher in SJS/TEN patient subgroup showing allopurinol drug-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) as compared to controls (28.6% vs 0%, P=0.00002, Pc=0.0011; 28.6% vs 0%, P=0.00002, Pc=0.001; 28.6% vs 0%, P=0.00002, Pc=0.001, respectively). In the same subgroup the frequencies of B*58:01, DRB1*15:02 and DRB1*13:02 alleles, although considerably higher than in control group (42.8% vs 5.2%, P=0.003; 28.6% vs 1.7%, P=0.005; 28.6% vs 3.5%, P=0.037, respectively), appeared no more statistically different after P correction (Pc=0.248; Pc=0.29; Pc=1.00, respectively). In addition, in 10 of the 20 SJS/TEN patient subgroup with paracetamol-induced SCAR no statistically significant association with HLA alleles could be found. However, in the same SJS/TEN patient subgroup showing allopurinol drug-induced SCAR, haplotype analysis indicated that B*58:01, DRB1*13:02 and DRB1*15:02 alleles, that in a single allele analysis lost statistical significance after P correction, may still confer susceptibility, because the B*58:01-DRB1*13:02 and DRB1*15:02-DQB1*05:02 are positively associated with the disease (14.2% vs 0.43%, P= 0.00001, Pc=0.00028; 14.2% vs 0.43%, P=0.00001, Pc=0.00028, respectively). Our results show that in contrast to SCAR-related to paracetamol, where HLA alleles do not appear to be involved, HLA molecules behave as a strong risk factor for SCAR-related to allopurinol even when a limited number of patients are considered.",2011

It mainly affects middle-aged women. AIH is occasionally complicated with liver cirrhosis that worsens the prognosis. Genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of AIH. Genetic studies of other diseases have been revealing of pathogenesis and drug efficacy. In this review, we summarize the genetic risk factors for AIH, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on European AIH revealed the strongest associations to be with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in HLA. Predisposing alleles for AIH were DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*04:01 in Europeans; DRB1*04:04, DRB1*04:05, and DRB1*13:01 in Latin Americans; and DRB1*04:01 and DRB1*04:05 in Japanese. Other risk SNVs in non-HLA genes for AIH were found by a candidate gene approach, but several SNVs were confirmed in replication studies. Some genetic factors of AIH overlapped with those of other autoimmune diseases. Larger-scale GWASs of other ethnic groups are required. The results of genetic studies might provide an explanation for the phenotypic heterogeneity of AIH and biomarkers for drug responses.",2021

HLA-G encodes two potentially functional polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region, 14bp insertion/deletion (14bp indel, rs371194629) and a single nucleotide polymorphism rs1063320, previously reported to affect HLA-G expression level or splicing isoform and to be associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the results of SLE association studies are inconsistent, probably due to the small sample size of each study and lack of consideration of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with HLA-class II haplotypes in each population. In this study, we performed association studies of these polymorphisms on 843 patients with SLE and 778 healthy controls in a Japanese population, in many of whom HLA-DRB1 alleles have been genotyped at the four-digit level. LD was detected between DRB1*13:02, protective against multiple autoimmune diseases in the Japanese, and the rs1063320 G (D' = 0.86, r2 = 0.02) and with 14bp del (D' = 0.62, r2 = 0.01), but not between SLE-susceptible DRB1*15:01 and HLA-G. Although significant association with overall SLE was not detected, 14bp ins allele was significantly associated with SLE with the age of onset <20 years, when compared with healthy controls (P = 0.0067, PFDR = 0.039, OR 1.44, additive model) or with SLE patients with the age of onset ≥20 (P = 0.033, PFDR = 0.0495, OR 2.09, additive model). This association remained significant after conditioning on DRB1*13:02 or DRB1*15:01. On the other hand, significant association was detected between rs1063320 C and anti-RNP antibody and anti-Sm antibody positive SLE, which was dependent on negative LD with DRB1*13:02. eQTL analysis showed reduced HLA-G mRNA level in 14bp ins/ins individuals. In conclusion, our observations showed that HLA-G 14bp ins allele represents a genetic contribution on early-onset SLE independent of DRB1. ",2016

The predisposing alleles are variable among ethnic groups and/or diseases. On the other hand, some HLA alleles are associated with resistance to systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, DRB1*13 alleles are the protective alleles shared by multiple autoimmune diseases. DRB1*13:01 allele is protective in European populations and DRB1*13:02 in Japanese. Because alleles in multiple HLA loci are in strong linkage disequilibrium, it is difficult to determine which of the protective alleles is functionally responsible for the protective effects. Thus far, association studies suggested that DRB1*13:02 represents at least one of the causally associated protective factors against multiple systemic autoimmune diseases in the Japanese population. The protective effect of DRB1*13 alleles appears to overcome the predisposing effect of the susceptible alleles in heterozygous individuals of DRB1*13 and the susceptible allele. A gene dosage effect was observed in the associations of DRB1*13:02 with the protection from systemic autoimmune diseases; thus homozygous individuals are more effectively protected from the systemic autoimmune diseases than heterozygotes. DRB1*13:02 also confers protection against organ-specific autoimmune diseases and some infectious diseases. Several hypotheses can be proposed for the molecular mechanisms of the protection conferred by DRB1*13, some of which can explain the dominant effect of DRB1*13 molecules over the susceptible alleles, but the actual protective function of DRB1*13 requires further study. Understanding of the protective mechanisms of DRB1*13 may lead to the identification of targets for the curative treatment of systemic autoimmune diseases.",2017

The major clinical variant, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is caused by a loss of intercellular adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes which is induced by IgG autoantibodies against components of desmosomes. Specifically, IgG against the desmosomal adhesion proteins, desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) and desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), preferentially target their ectodomains which are presumably critical for the transinteraction and signalling function of these adhesion molecules. There is a close immunogenetic association of PV with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, HLA-DRB1*04:02 and HLA-DQB1*05:03. These have been shown to be critical for the presentation of immunodominant peptides to autoreactive CD4+ T helper cells. The importance of autoaggressive T-B cell interaction in the induction of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies which directly cause epidermal loss of adhesion has been demonstrated both clinically (by the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab) and experimentally (in PV mouse models). The strong association of clinically active pemphigus with autoantibodies of the IgG<sub>4</sub> and IgE subclasses strongly suggests that T helper 2 cells are critical regulators of the immune pathogenesis of pemphigus. Novel therapeutic approaches target autoreactive T and B cells to specifically interfere with the T cell-dependent activation of B cells leading to the generation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells. Our improved understanding of the autoantibody-driven effector phase of pemphigus has led to the introduction of novel therapies that target pathogenic autoantibodies such as immunoadsorption and drugs that block pathogenic autoantibody-induced cell signalling events.",2018
