# AllergenSensitization

Codes and Data used in the study of Allergen Sensitization and HLA association.
We use clinincal testing of mix common allergens to evaluate IgE-levels of population sample.
The allergen mixtures have allergens from food, dust and other common allergen keeps challenging the population.

# HLA-typing was performed by imputing HLA type using WGS using different methods

# Association study performed using logistic regression at different resolution of genotype.


# ./pyCodes for individual models

# see notebooks for comparing association results.
