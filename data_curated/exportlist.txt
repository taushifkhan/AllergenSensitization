   abstract = {Asthma, rhinitis, and eczema are complex diseases with multiple genetic and environmental factors interlinked through IgE-associated and non-IgE-associated mechanisms. Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL; EU FP7-CP-IP; project no: 261357; 2010-2015) studied the complex links of allergic diseases at the clinical and mechanistic levels by linking epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic research, including in vivo and in vitro models. MeDALL integrated 14 European birth cohorts, including 44,010 participants and 160 cohort follow-ups between pregnancy and age 20 years. Thirteen thousand children were prospectively followed after puberty by using a newly standardized MeDALL Core Questionnaire. A microarray developed for allergen molecules with increased IgE sensitivity was obtained for 3,292 children. Estimates of air pollution exposure from previous studies were available for 10,000 children. Omics data included those from historical genome-wide association studies (23,000 children) and DNA methylation (2,173), targeted multiplex biomarker (1,427), and transcriptomic (723) studies. Using classical epidemiology and machine-learning methods in 16,147 children aged 4 years and 11,080 children aged 8 years, MeDALL showed the multimorbidity of eczema, rhinitis, and asthma and estimated that only 38% of multimorbidity was attributable to IgE sensitization. MeDALL has proposed a new vision of multimorbidity independent of IgE sensitization, and has shown that monosensitization and polysensitization represent 2 distinct phenotypes. The translational component of MeDALL is shown by the identification of a novel allergic phenotype characterized by polysensitization and multimorbidity, which is associated with the frequency, persistence, and severity of allergic symptoms. The results of MeDALL will help integrate personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory approaches in allergic diseases.},

   abstract = {Food allergies are defined as adverse immune responses to food proteins that result in typical clinical symptoms involving the dermatologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and/or neurologic systems. IgE-mediated food-allergic disease differs from non-IgE-mediated disease because the pathophysiology results from activation of the immune system, causing a T helper 2 response which results in IgE binding to Fcepsilon receptors on effector cells like mast cells and basophils. The activation of these cells causes release of histamine and other preformed mediators, and rapid symptom onset, in contrast with non-IgE-mediated food allergy which is more delayed in onset. The diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy requires a history of classic clinical symptoms and evidence of food-specific IgE by either skin-prick or serum-specific IgE testing. Symptoms of IgE-mediated food allergies range from mild to severe. The severity of symptoms is not predicted by the level of specific IgE or skin test wheal size, but the likelihood of symptom onset is directly related. Diagnosis is excluded when a patient can ingest the suspected food without clinical symptoms and may require an in-office oral food challenge if testing for food-specific IgE by serum or skin testing is negative or low. Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of the clinical manifestation of IgE-mediated food allergy, and injectable epinephrine is the first-line treatment. Management of food allergies requires strict avoidance measures, counseling of the family about constant vigilance, and prompt treatment of allergic reactions with emergency medications. Guidelines have changed recently to include early introduction of peanuts at 4-6 months of life. Early introduction is recommended to prevent the development of peanut allergy. Future treatments for IgE-mediated food allergy evaluated in clinical trials include epicutaneous, sublingual, and oral immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are characterized by a multifactorial aetiology and a complex genetic background, with the MHC region playing a major role. We genotyped for HLA-DRB1 locus 1228 patients with AIDs-213 with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), 166 with Psoriasis or Psoriatic Arthritis (Ps + PsA), 153 with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), 67 with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), 536 with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and 93 with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and 282 unrelated controls. We confirmed previously established associations of HLA-DRB1( *)15 (OR = 2.17) and HLA-DRB1( *)03 (OR = 1.81) alleles with MS, HLA-DRB1( *)03 with SLE (OR = 2.49), HLA-DRB1( *)01 (OR = 1.79) and HLA-DRB1( *)04 (OR = 2.81) with RA, HLA-DRB1( *)07 with Ps + PsA (OR = 1.79), HLA-DRB1( *)01 (OR = 2.28) and HLA-DRB1( *)08 (OR = 3.01) with SSc, and HLA-DRB1( *)03 with MG (OR = 2.98). We further observed a consistent negative association of HLA-DRB1( *)13 allele with SLE, Ps + PsA, RA, and SSc (18.3%, 19.3%, 16.3%, and 11.9%, resp., versus 29.8% in controls). HLA-DRB1( *)13 frequency in the AIDs group was 20.0% (OR = 0.58). Although different alleles were associated with particular AIDs, the same allele, HLA-DRB1( *)13, was underrepresented in all of the six diseases analysed. This observation suggests that this allele may confer protection for AIDs, particularly for systemic and rheumatic disease. The protective effect of HLA-DRB1( *)13 could be explained by a more proficient antigen presentation by these molecules, favouring efficient clonal deletion during thymic selection.},

Over 100 cohorts focusing on asthma and allergy have been initiated in the world over the past 30 years. Since 2004, several research initiatives funded under the EU Framework Program for Research and Technological Development FP6-FP7 have attempted to identify, compare, and evaluate pooling data from existing European birth cohorts (GA(2)LEN: Global Allergy and European Network, FP6; ENRIECO: Environmental Health Risks in European Birth Cohorts, FP7; CHICOS: Developing a Child Cohort Research Strategy for Europe, FP7; MeDALL: Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy, FP7). However, there is a general lack of knowledge about these initiatives and their potentials. The aim of this paper is to review current and past EU-funded projects in order to make a summary of their goals and achievements and to suggest future research needs of these European birth cohort networks.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: While the molecular mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis remain obscure, there is mounting evidence supporting a key role for autoimmunity. Although human leukocyte antigens (HLA) alleles have been repeatedly associated with autoimmune processes, the relation between HLA and COPD remains largely unexplored, especially in Latin American (LA) populations. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the presence of HLA class I and II alleles in COPD patients and healthy controls in a LA population with admixed ancestry. METHODS: COPD patients (n=214) and age-matched controls (n=193) were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array. The classic HLA alleles were imputed using HLA Genotype Imputation with Attribute Bagging (HIBAG) and the Hispanic reference panel. Finally, the distribution of HLA-DRB1 alleles was reexamined in 510 randomly recruited unrelated volunteers. RESULTS: CODP patients showed a higher HLA-DRB1*01:02 allele frequency (6.54%) than healthy controls (3.27%, p=0.04, OR=2.07). HLA-DRB1*01:02 was also significantly associated with FEV1 (p=0.04) and oxygen saturation (p=0.02), and the FEV1/FVC ratio was higher in HLA-DRB1*15:01-positive patients (p=9x10(-3)). CONCLUSION: We report an association among HLA-DRB1 alleles, COPD risk and pulmonary function parameters for the first time in Latin Americans. Since HLA-DRB1 genetic variability relates to the individual autoimmune response, these results support a role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of COPD.},

Food allergies appear to have independent risk factors that differ from other allergic diseases.

   abstract = {Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) is a life-threatening food allergy triggered by wheat in combination with the second factor such as exercise. The identification of potential genetic risk factors for this allergy might help high-risk individuals before consuming wheat-containing food. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with WDEIA. A genome-wide association study was conducted in a discovery set of 77 individuals with WDEIA and 924 control subjects via three genetic models. The associations were confirmed in a replication set of 91 affected individuals and 435 control individuals. Summary statistics from the combined set were analyzed by meta-analysis with a random-effect model. In the discovery set, a locus on chromosome 6, rs9277630, was associated with WDEIA in the dominant model (OR = 3.95 [95% CI, 2.31-6.73], p = 7.87 × 10},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allergy, the most frequent immune disorder affecting 30% of the world's population, is the consequence of immunoglobin E (IgE) sensitization to allergens. Among the genetic factors suspected to be involved in allergy, the HLA class-II genomic region is a strong candidate. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between HLA class-II alleles and specific IgE (sIgE) sensitization to a large number of respiratory allergen molecules. METHODS: The analysis relied on 927 participants of the EGEA cohort, including 497 asthmatics. The study focuses on 26 aeroallergens recognized by sIgE in at least 5% of the study population (determined with the MEDALL chip with sIgE >/= 0.3 ISU) and 23 imputed HLA class-II alleles. For each sIgE sensitization and HLA class-II allele, we fitted a logistic regression model accounting for familial dependence and adjusted for gender, age, and genetic principal components. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons (False Discovery Rate). RESULTS: Most of the 19 statistically significant associations observed regard pollen allergens (mugwort Art v 1, olive tree Ole e 1, timothy grass Phl p 2, Phl p 5 and plantain Pla l 1), three were mold allergen (Alternaria Alt a 1), and a single one regards house dust mite allergen (Der p 7). No association was observed with pet allergens. The strongest associations were found with mugwort Art v 1 (OR = 5.42 (95%CI, 3.30; 8.88), 4.14 (2.65; 6.47), 3.16 (1.88; 5.31) with DQB1*05:01, DQA1*01:01 and DRB1*01:01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results support the important role of HLA class-II alleles as immune response genes predisposing their carriers for sensitization to various major pollen allergens.},

The study population was comprised of children ages 6-7 and 13-14 years, along with their parents or guardians. The English and Arabic versions of the GAN questionnaires were used to collect data for this study. A total of 2646 participants were recruited (1210 in the 6-7 years age group and 1436 in the 13-14 years age group), in addition to a total of 3831 parents or guardians. The overall prevalence of diagnosed asthma, lifetime allergic rhinitis, and diagnosed eczema in our study sample were as follows: 34.6%, 30.9%, and 37.4%, respectively. The current study showed an increased prevalence rate of asthma and eczema comparing to previous local estimates. These rates were higher in some cases or comparable in other cases to those found elsewhere. It is recommended that future research focus on studying the various factors contributing to the cases of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema in Qatar. The reporting of this study conforms with the STROBE statement.},

   abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify rare allelic variants and HLA alleles in narcolepsy patients with hypocretin (orexin, HCRT) deficiency but lacking DQB1*06:02. SETTINGS: China (Peking University People's Hospital), Czech Republic (Charles University), Denmark (Golstrup Hospital), Italy (University of Bologna), Korea (Catholic University), and USA (Stanford University). DESIGN: CSF hypocretin-1, DQB1*06:02, clinical and polysomnographic data were collected in narcolepsy patients (552 with and 144 without cataplexy) from 6 sites. Numbers of cases with and without DQB1*06:02 and low CSF hypocretin-1 were compiled. HLA class I (A, B, C), class II (DRBs, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1), and whole exome sequencing were conducted in 9 DQB1*06:02 negative cases with low CSF hypocretin-1. Sanger sequencing of selected exons in DNMT1, HCRT, and MOG was performed to exclude mutations in known narcolepsy-associated genes. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Classic narcolepsy markers DQB1*06:02 and low CSF hypocretin-1 were found in 87.4% of cases with cataplexy, and in 20.0% without cataplexy. Nine cases (all with cataplexy) were DQB1*06:02 negative with low CSF hypocretin-1, constituting 1.7% [0.8%-3.4%] of all cases with cataplexy and 1.8% [0.8%-3.4%] of cases with low CSF hypocretin independent of cataplexy across sites. Five HLA negative subjects had severe cataplexy, often occurring without clear triggers. Subjects had diverse ethnic backgrounds and HLA alleles at all loci, suggesting no single secondary HLA association. The rare subtype DPB1*0901, and homologous DPB1*10:01 subtype, were present in 5 subjects, suggesting a secondary association with HLA-DP. Preprohypocretin sequencing revealed no mutations beyond one previously reported in a very early onset case. No new MOG or DNMT1 mutations were found, nor were suspicious or private variants in novel genes identified through exome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Hypocretin, MOG, or DNMT1 mutations are exceptional findings in DQB1*06:02 negative cases with hypocretin deficiency. A secondary HLA-DP association may be present in these cases. These represent particularly difficult diagnostic challenges.},

   abstract = {The relationship between viral infection and obesity has been known for several decades but epidemiological data is limited to only a few viral pathogens. The association between obesity and a wide range of viruses was assessed using VirScan, a pan-viral serological profiling tool. Serum specimens from 457 Qatari adults (lean = 184; obese = 273) and 231 Qatari children (lean = 111; obese = 120) were analyzed by VirScan. Associations with obesity were determined by odds ratio (OR) and Fisher's test (p values), and by multivariate regression analysis to adjust for age and gender. Although there was no association of viral infections with obesity in the pediatric population, a nominal association of obesity with seropositivity to members of the Herpesviridae family is observed for the adult population (OR = 1.5-3.3; p < 0.05). After adjusting p values for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction) the odds of being obese is significantly higher in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) seropositive Qatari adults (OR = 3.3; 95% CI 2.15-4.99; p = 2.787E - 08). By VirScan, the sero-prevalence of HSV1 is 81.3% and 57.1% among Qatari obese and lean adult populations, respectively. Higher prevalence of antibodies against several peptide epitopes of HSV-1/2 is positively associated with obesity (OR = 2.35-3.82; p </= 3.981E - 05). By multivariate regression analysis, HSV-1 was independently associated with obesity irrespective of age and gender. Our results suggest that obesity among Qataris may be associated with a higher prevalence of herpesvirus infections, in particular HSV-1. Furthermore, the high prevalence of antibodies against peptide antigens specific to HSV-1 and -2 in the obese population suggests that these viral peptides may play a role in adipogenesis. Further studies with these candidate peptides in cell culture or animal models may confirm their adipogenic roles.},

   abstract = {In most industrialized countries, allergies have increased in frequency quite dramatically during the past 50 years. Estimates show that 20-30% of the populations are affected. Allergies have thereby become one of the major medical challenges of the twenty-first century. Despite several theories including the hygiene hypothesis, there are still very few solid clues concerning the causes of this increase. To trace the origins of allergies, we have studied cells and molecules of importance for the development of IgE-mediated allergies, including the repertoire of immunoglobulin genes. These studies have shown that IgE and IgG most likely appeared by a gene duplication of IgY in an early mammal, possibly 220-300 million years ago. Receptors specific for IgE and IgG subsequently appeared in parallel with the increase in Ig isotypes from a subfamily of the recently identified Fc receptor-like molecules. Circulating IgE levels are generally very low in humans and laboratory rodents. However, when dogs and Scandinavian wolfs were analyzed, IgE levels were found to be 100-200 times higher compared to humans, indicating a generally much more active IgE synthesis in free-living animals, most likely connected to intestinal parasite infections. One of the major effector molecules released upon IgE-mediated activation by mast cells are serine proteases. These proteases, which belong to the large family of hematopoietic serine proteases, are extremely abundant and can account for up to 35% of the total cellular protein. Recent studies show that several of these enzymes, including the chymases and tryptases, are old. Ancestors for these enzymes were most likely present in an early mammal more than 200 million years ago before the separation of the three extant mammalian lineages; monotremes, marsupials, and placental mammals. The aim is now to continue these studies of mast cell biology and IgE to obtain additional clues to their evolutionary conserved functions. A focus concerns why the humoral immune response involving IgE and mast cells have become so dysregulated in humans as well as several of our domestic companion animals.},

One novel allele was found in two unrelated patients that were HLA typed for different reasons at two different times, suggesting that novel alleles may be much more frequent than previously expected. If the rate of identification is hindered by bioinformatics challenges, there is a great potential for our patients to suffer needlessly from incomplete information in either diagnostics or unrecognized incompatibilities with potential donors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mugwort pollen allergens are the main cause of pollinosis in late summer in Europe. Ninety-five percent of patients allergic to mugwort are sensitized to the major allergen Art v 1. In contrast to other common pollen allergens that contain multiple T-cell epitopes, Art v 1 contains only 1 immunodominant T-cell epitope (Art v 1 25-36 ). OBJECTIVE: To characterize the minimal epitope of Art v 1 25-36 and to investigate a possible association of Art v 1 reactivity with HLA class II phenotypes. METHODS: Art v 1-specific T-cell lines and clones were established from 51 patients with clinically defined mugwort pollen allergy and IgE specific for Art v 1. To define minimal epitopes and binding sites within Art v 1 25-36 , truncated and single-substitution analog peptides were used for T-cell stimulation. To study HLA restriction, monoclonal anti-HLA antibodies and antigen-presenting cells with defined HLA-DRB and -DQB1 alleles were used. HLA typing of patients with allergy was performed by hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotides, PCR, and nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: In 96% of the patients, a cellular response to Art v 1 25-36 was obtained, and a core region of 5 to 10 amino acids containing 3 to 5 amino acids essential for T-cell reactivity was defined. The frequency of HLA-DRB1 * 01 in patients recognizing Art v 1 25-36 was significantly increased as compared with healthy controls (69% vs 21%; odds ratio, 8.45; P < 10 -6 ), and HLA-DRB1 * 01 was identified as the main restriction element for the presentation of the immunodominant epitope. CONCLUSIONS: Allergy to Art v 1 is characterized by a uniform T-cell response. The disease is apparently associated with the HLA-DR1 phenotype. Therefore, mugwort pollinosis is an ideal candidate for a peptide-based immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases among schoolchildren aged 6-14 years in the State of Qatar, based on a questionnaire designed by the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC). A cross-sectional study of 3,283 school children living in both urban and rural areas (average age, 9.03 +/- 1.99 years; 52.3% boys and 47.7% girls) was conducted between February 2003-February 2004. The population sample had a high prevalence of diagnosed asthma (19.8%), allergic rhinitis (30.5%), eczema (22.5%), and chest infection (11.9%). The frequency of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema among parents reflected the same pattern as seen in their children. Overall, males had more asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chest infections than females. In general, the prevalence rate of asthma and allergic rhinitis decreased with age. The prevalence rate of asthma was significantly higher in mothers (11.8%) than in fathers (9.0%), but the frequency of allergic rhinitis symptoms was comparable (mothers, 18.5%; fathers, 17.5%). The prevalence rate of asthma (19.8%) in Qatari schoolchildren is very close to that in the neighboring Gulf country, Oman (20.7%), and higher than in some developing countries. Genetic factors related to the high rates of consanguinity may play an important role in the high prevalence rates noted in the Qatari population, but changes in lifestyle and environmental factors cannot be discounted as possible causes of the high prevalence noted in this study.},

   abstract = {Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with acute respiratory infection in humans. B cell responses to these "common cold" viruses remain incompletely understood. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of CoV-specific antibody repertoires in 231 children and 1168 adults using phage immunoprecipitation sequencing. Seroprevalence of antibodies against endemic HCoVs ranged between approximately 4% and 27% depending on the species and cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid, and matrix proteins. Moreover, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2' cleavage site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and nonhuman coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody responses in adult donors. Our findings shed light on the dominant species-specific and pan-CoV target sites of human antibody responses to coronavirus infection, thereby providing important insights for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design.},

   abstract = {Food allergy is an increasingly important health problem in the world. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on European ancestry samples have identified food allergy-specific loci in the HLA class II region. We conducted GWAS of self-reported reactivity with common foods using the data from 11011 Japanese women and identified shrimp and peach allergy-specific loci in the HLA-DR/DQ gene region tagged by rs74995702 (P = 6.30 x 10(-17), OR = 1.91) and rs28359884 (P = 2.3 x 10(-12), OR = 1.80), respectively. After HLA imputation using a Japanese population-specific reference, the most strongly associated haplotype was HLA-DRB1*04:05-HLA-DQB1*04:01 for shrimp allergy (P = 3.92 x 10(-19), OR = 1.99) and HLA-DRB1*09:01-HLA-DQB1*03:03 for peach allergy (P = 1.15 x 10(-7), OR = 1.68). Additionally, both allergies' associated variants were eQTLs for several HLA genes, with HLA-DQA2 the single eQTL gene shared between the two traits. Our study suggests that allergy to certain foods may be related to genetic differences that tag both HLA alleles having particular epitope binding specificities as well as variants modulating expression of particular HLA genes. Investigating this further could increase our understanding of food allergy aetiology and potentially lead to better therapeutic strategies for allergen immunotherapies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: IgE responses to house dust mite-derived allergens seem to be the most important in the development of atopic asthma and rhinitis, but it has been difficult to demonstrate genetic control of the IgE response to the allergens. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to investigate the association between sensitization to house dust mite, D. pteronyssinus (DP), and genotypes of HLA-DRB1 alleles. METHODS: DNAs were extracted from two groups of unrelated Koreans: (1) 178 with sensitization to DP; and (2) 99 age-matched non-atopic controls. Genotypes of the HLA-DRB1 alleles were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. RESULTS: The frequency of HLA-DRB1*07 was significantly increased in the DP-sensitive subjects compared with the controls (15.7% vs 4.0%, P = 0.009). Conversely, the frequencies of HLA-DRB1*04 and *14 were decreased in the DP-sensitive subjects compared with the controls (27.5% vs 45.5%, P = 0.002; 13.5% vs 24.2%, P = 0.02). Of the DRB1*04 alleles, DRB1*0403 was significantly decreased in the DP-sensitive subjects compared with the controls (3.9% vs 13.1%, P = 0.005). No significant differences were found in the distributions of the other HLA-DRB1 alleles between the two groups. CONCLUSION: HLA-DRB1*07 may have a susceptibility, and DRB1*04 and DRB1*14 may have a protective effect, upon the development of a sensitization to DP.},

   abstract = {Mugwort pollen allergens represent the main cause of pollinosis in late summer. The major allergen, Art v 1, contains only one single immunodominant, solely HLA-DR-restricted T cell epitope (Art v 125-36). The frequency of HLA-DRB1*01 is highly increased in mugwort-allergic individuals and HLA-DR1 serves as restriction element for Art v 125-36. However, Art v 125-36 also binds to HLA-DR4 with high affinity and DR1-restricted Art v 125-36 -specific T cell receptors can be activated by HLA-DR4 molecules. To understand the predominance of HLA-DR1 in mugwort allergy in spite of the degeneracy in HLA/peptide-binding and TCR-recognition, we investigated the molecular background of Art v 125-36 /MHC/TCR interactions in the context of HLA-DR1 compared to -DR4.|The majority of Art v 125-36 -specific T cell lines and clones from HLA-DR1 carrying, mugwort pollen-allergic donors reacted to synthetic and naturally processed Art v 1-peptides when presented by HLA-DR1 or HLA-DR4 expressing antigen presenting cells. However, at limiting peptide concentrations DR1 was more effective in T cell stimulation. In addition, the minimal epitope for 50% of Art v 125-36 -specific T cells was shorter for DR1 than for DR4. In vitro binding assays of Art v 125-36 mutant peptides to isolated DR1- and DR4-molecules indicated similar binding capacities and use of the same register. In silico simulation of Art v 125-36 binding to HLA-DR1 and -DR4 suggested similar binding of the central part of the peptide to either molecule, but a higher flexibility of the N- and C-terminal amino acids and detachment at the C-terminus in HLA-DR1.|The predominance of HLA-DR1 in the response to Art v 125-36 may be explained by subtle conformation changes of the peptide bound to DR1 compared to DR4. Computer simulation supported our experimental data by demonstrating differences in peptide mobility within the HLA-DR complex that may influence TCR-binding. We suggest that the minor differences observed in vitro may be more relevant in the microenvironment in vivo, so that only presentation by HLA-DR1, but not -DR4 permits successful T cell activation.},

Although the prevalence of FA is increasing, the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for the onset of this immune disorder are not yet clarified. Genetic factors seem to play a leading role in the development of FA, though interaction with environmental factors cannot be excluded. The broader network of genetic loci mediating the risk of this complex disorder remains to be identified. The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) has been associated with various immune disorders, including FA. This review aims to unravel the potential associations between HLA gene functions and the manifestation and outcome of FA disorders.

Host-commensal interactions have been described for the gut microbiome, but little is known about the epidermal microbiome. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated whether genetic variants associated with skin traits affect the axillary microbiome. METHODS: Eight skin trait-related single nucleotide polymorphisms and HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DPB1 were genotyped in 186 Japanese males. From axillary swabs, the intensity of a representative axillary odor, trans (E) isomer of 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid (E3M2H), was quantified with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the diversity of the axillary microbiome was evaluated with a 16 s rRNA metagenomic approach, and the association of these characteristics was assessed statistically. RESULTS: A risk allele for atopic dermatitis of rs878860 in NLRP10 and the allele for wet earwax of rs17822931 in ABCC11 decreased the relative abundance of Corynebacterium. Conversely, these alleles increased the relative abundance of Staphylococcus. Metagenomic analysis revealed that beta-diversity showed significant dissimilarity at the weighted Unifrac distance between minor allele carrier and non-carrier groups in HLA-DPB1*05:01, rs17822931, and rs878860. HLA-DPB1*04:01, HLA-DPB1*05:01, and rs17822931 were associated with E3M2H. CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel candidate loci associated with the axillary microbiome and malodor.},

   abstract = {Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes confer substantial risk for autoimmune diseases on a log-additive scale. Here we speculated that differences in autoantigen-binding repertoires between a heterozygote's two expressed HLA variants might result in additional non-additive risk effects. We tested the non-additive disease contributions of classical HLA alleles in patients and matched controls for five common autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (ncases = 5,337), type 1 diabetes (T1D; ncases = 5,567), psoriasis vulgaris (ncases = 3,089), idiopathic achalasia (ncases = 727) and celiac disease (ncases = 11,115). In four of the five diseases, we observed highly significant, non-additive dominance effects (rheumatoid arthritis, P = 2.5 × 10(-12); T1D, P = 2.4 × 10(-10); psoriasis, P = 5.9 × 10(-6); celiac disease, P = 1.2 × 10(-87)). In three of these diseases, the non-additive dominance effects were explained by interactions between specific classical HLA alleles (rheumatoid arthritis, P = 1.8 × 10(-3); T1D, P = 8.6 × 10(-27); celiac disease, P = 6.0 × 10(-100)). These interactions generally increased disease risk and explained moderate but significant fractions of phenotypic variance (rheumatoid arthritis, 1.4%; T1D, 4.0%; celiac disease, 4.1%) beyond a simple additive model.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allergic disease is on the rise worldwide. Effective prevention of allergic disease requires comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to its intermediate phenotypes, such as sensitization to common allergens. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the degree of genetic and environmental contributions to sensitization to food and aeroallergens. METHODS: Sensitization was defined as a positive skin prick test to an allergen. We calculated the zygosity-specific concordance rates and odds ratios (ORs) for sensitization to food and aeroallergens in 826 Chinese twin pairs [472 monozygotic (MZ) and 354 dizygotic (DZ)] aged 12-28 years. We also applied structural equation modelling procedures to estimate genetic and environmental influences on sensitization. RESULTS: The concordance rates and risk of sensitization in one twin given the presence vs. the absence of sensitization in the other twin were higher in MZ twins than those in DZ twins. However, a large number of MZ twins were discordant in sensitization to common allergens. These observations suggest both genetic and environmental factors influence sensitization. Consistently, the estimated heritability and individual environmental components of the liability to sensitization ranged from 0.51 to 0.68 and 0.32 to 0.49, respectively, based on the best-fitted structural equation model. We also observed high phenotypic correlations between sensitization to two aeroallergens (cockroach and dust mite: 0.83) and two food allergens (peanut and shellfish: 0.58), but only moderate correlations for the pairs between sensitization to a food and an aeroallergen (0.31-0.46). The shared genetic and environmental factors between paired sensitizations contribute to the observed correlations. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that sensitization to common food and aeroallergens were influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, we found that paired allergen sensitizations might share some common sets of genes and environmental factors. This study underscores the need to further delineate unique and/or pleiotropic genetic and environmental factors for allergen sensitization.},

   abstract = {Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a waxing and waning illness of childhood that is likely caused by interactions between an altered skin barrier and immune dysregulation. The goal of our study was to evaluate the association of DRB1 genetic variants and the persistence of AD using whole exome sequencing and high resolution typing. DRB1 was interrogated based on previous reports that utilized high throughput techniques. We evaluated an ongoing nation-wide long-term cohort of children with AD in which patients are asked every 6months about their medication use and their AD symptoms. In total, 87 African-American and 50 European-American children were evaluated. Genetic association analysis was performed using a software tool focusing on amino acid variable positions shared by HLA-DRB1 alleles covering the antigen presenting domain. Amino acid variations at position 9 (pocket 9), position 26, and position 78 (pocket 4) were marginally associated with the prevalence of AD. However, the odds ratio was 0.30 (0.14, 0.68; p=0.003) for residue 78, 0.27 (0.10, 0.69; p=0.006) for residue 26 and not significant for residue 9 with respect to the persistence of AD. In conclusion, amino acid variations at peptide-binding pockets of HLA-DRB1 were associated with the persistence of AD in African-American children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma is a complex inflammatory lung disease that results from allergic and nonallergic environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals. The interrelationship and impact of environmental and genetic determinants on the development of asthma is still unclear. Monozygotic twins (MZT) have been considered a potentially useful population to investigate the role of genetic and environmental factors on asthma because of their identical genetic background, similar childhood environmental exposures, and expected high concordance rate for asthma. METHODS: A detailed questionnaire designed to obtain demographic information, medical history/severity of asthma, and environmental exposures was distributed to 43 pairs of MZT pairs where one or both probands had a history of asthma. All twin pairs were clinically evaluated for atopy by skin testing. Asthma was assessed by questionnaire, baseline spirometry, disease severity, airway reactivity, and medication scores. RESULTS: Based on a history of physician-diagnosed asthma, disease severity, airway reactivity, and medication scores, 22 MZT pairs were identified as concordant (C) for asthma while 21 MZT pairs were discordant (D) for asthma. Those MZT-C for asthma were on average older and more often female. Adjusted odds ratios for age and gender revealed that MZT-C for asthma had a 2.3 greater likelihood of childhood tobacco exposure and a 1.8 greater likelihood of early exposure to a pet compared to MZT-D pairs. In addition, MZT-C for asthma had a 2.4 greater likelihood of being full term vs. premature at birth. None of these odds ratios were statistically significant due to a small sample size. However, a trend for a greater likelihood of earlier environmental exposures was observed for MZT-C asthma pairs. Among MZT-D probands, a history of asthma in one proband was supported by a lower FEV1 and higher airway reactivity, disease severity, asthma symptom, and medication scores compared to the nonasthma proband. There was significant intrapair heterogeneity among MZT-C and MZT-D probands in their positive skin test responses to specific aeroallergens. CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional evaluation of larger MZT populations where one or both proband has asthma with a long-term prospective follow-up may be a feasible way for identifying the impact of environmental determinants as independent risk factors for the development of asthma.},

   abstract = {Binding of small molecules in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptide-binding groove may result in conformational changes of bound peptide and an altered immune response, but previous studies have not considered a potential role for endogenous metabolites. We performed virtual screening of the complete Human Metabolite Database (HMDB) for docking to the multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptible DRB1*15:01 allele and compared the results to the closely related yet non-susceptible DRB1*15:03 allele; and assessed the potential impact on binding of human myelin basic peptide (MBP). We observed higher energy scores for metabolite binding to DRB1*15:01 than DRB1*15:03. Structural comparison of docked metabolites with DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*15:03 complexed with MBP revealed that Phenylalanine(MBP92) allows binding of metabolites in the P4 pocket of DRB1*15:01 but Valine(MBP89) abrogates metabolite binding in the P1 pocket. We observed differences in the energy scores for binding of metabolites in the P4 pockets of DRB1*15:01 vs. DRB1*15:03 suggesting stronger binding to DRB1*15:01. Our study confirmed that specific, disease-associated human metabolites bind effectively with the most polymorphic P4 pocket of DRB1*15:01, the primary MS susceptible allele in most populations. Our results suggest that endogenous human metabolites bound in specific pockets of HLA may be immunomodulatory and implicated in autoimmune disease.},

   abstract = {Allergic reactions occur when IgE molecules become crosslinked by antigens such as food proteins. Here we create the 'AllerScan' programmable phage display system to characterize the binding specificities of anti-allergen IgG and IgE antibodies in serum against thousands of allergenic proteins from hundreds of organisms at peptide resolution. Using AllerScan, we identify robust anti-wheat IgE reactivities in wheat allergic individuals but not in wheat-sensitized individuals. Meanwhile, a key wheat epitope in alpha purothionin elicits dominant IgE responses among allergic patients, and frequent IgG responses among sensitized and non-allergic patients. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial shows that alpha purothionin reactivity, among others, is strongly modulated by oral immunotherapy in tolerized individuals. AllerScan may thus serve as a high-throughput platform for unbiased analysis of anti-allergen antibody specificities.},

   abstract = {IgE-dependent mast cell activation is a major effector mechanism underlying the pathology associated with allergic disorders. The most dramatic of these IgE-associated disorders is the fatal anaphylaxis which can occur in some people who have developed IgE antibodies to otherwise innocuous antigens, such as those contained in certain foods and medicines. Why would such a highly "maladaptive" immune response develop in evolution and be retained to the present day? Host defense against parasites has long been considered the only beneficial function that might be conferred by IgE and mast cells. However, recent studies have provided evidence that, in addition to participating in host resistance to certain parasites, mast cells and IgE are critical components of innate (mast cells) and adaptive (mast cells and IgE) immune responses that can enhance host defense against the toxicity of certain arthropod and animal venoms, including enhancing the survival of mice injected with such venoms. Yet, in some people, developing IgE antibodies to insect or snake venoms puts them at risk for having a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction upon subsequent exposure to such venoms. Delineating the mechanisms underlying beneficial versus detrimental innate and adaptive immune responses associated with mast cell activation and IgE is likely to enhance our ability to identify potential therapeutic targets in such settings, not only for reducing the pathology associated with allergic disorders but perhaps also for enhancing immune protection against pathogens and animal venoms.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The HLA (human leukocyte antigen) class II genes DQB1 and DRB1 and the Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha gene (TNFA) within the HLA complex (chromosome 6p21) have been associated with asthma and allergy. Due to the strong linkage disequilibrium characterizing this complex and the multiple asthma/allergy expressions, we aimed to determine which of these genes were primarily involved in specific asthma/allergy traits. METHODS: The DRB1-DQB1 alleles and TNFA-308 polymorphism were genotyped in 959 children from the Environment and Childhood Asthma study and analyzed for possible associations with allergic and non-allergic asthma (with/without at least one positive skin prick test for allergens) and specific allergic sensitization, as well as bronchial hyperresponsiveness and total IgE, using both allele and extended haplotype analyses. RESULTS: Different genes within the HLA complex were associated with separate asthma and allergy traits. Nonallergic asthma was associated with both the TNFA-308A allele [Odds ratio (OR) 1.7 (1.3-2.3)] and DRB1 03 allele [OR 1.6(1-2.6)], but extended DRB1 03-TNFA-308 haplotype analysis suggested that the DRB1-DQB1 association was secondary to linkage disequilibrium with the TNFA-308 polymorphism. Allergies were associated with HLA class II alleles only; birch sensitization with DQB1 0603-DRB1 13 [OR 2.3 (1.4-4.0)] and mugwort sensitization with DQB1 0609-DRB1 13 [OR 7.1 (1.9-27.0)] and DQB1 0501-DRB1 01 [OR 2.0 (1.0-4.0)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that asthma is not associated with DRB1 or DQB1 but rather TNFA or a gene(s) in linkage disequilibrium, while sensitization to specific allergens is associated with particular alleles at the DQ and/or DR loci. A novel association between DQB1 0603-DRB1 13 and birch allergy is identified.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hay fever or seasonal allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic disorder associated with IgE sensitization to grass. The underlying genetic variants have not been studied comprehensively. There is overwhelming evidence that those who have older siblings have less AR, although the mechanism for this remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify common genetic variant associations with prevalent AR and grass sensitization using existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and to determine whether genetic variants modify the protective effect of older siblings. METHOD: Approximately 2.2 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms were investigated in 4 large European adult cohorts for AR (3,933 self-reported cases vs 8,965 control subjects) and grass sensitization (2,315 cases vs 10,032 control subjects). RESULTS: Three loci reached genome-wide significance for either phenotype. The HLA variant rs7775228, which cis-regulates HLA-DRB4, was strongly associated with grass sensitization and weakly with AR (P(grass) = 1.6 x 10(-9); P(AR) = 8.0 x 10(-3)). Variants in a locus near chromosome 11 open reading frame 30 (C11orf30) and leucine-rich repeat containing 32 (LRRC32), which was previously associated with atopic dermatitis and eczema, were also strongly associated with both phenotypes (rs2155219; P(grass) = 9.4 x 10(-9); P(AR) = 3.8 x 10(-8)). The third genome-wide significant variant was rs17513503 (P(grass) = 1.2 x 10(-8); PAR = 7.4 x 10(-7)) which was located near transmembrane protein 232 (TMEM232) and solute carrier family 25, member 46 (SLC25A46). Twelve further loci with suggestive associations were also identified. Using a candidate gene approach, where we considered variants within 164 genes previously thought to be important, we found variants in 3 further genes that may be of interest: thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), Toll-like receptor 6 (TLR6) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 (NOD1/CARD4). We found no evidence for variants that modified the effect of birth order on either phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively large meta-analysis of GWASs identified few loci associated with AR and grass sensitization. No birth order interaction was identified in the current analyses.},

   abstract = {Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare disorder characterized by hypoplastic bone marrow and progressive pancytopenia. The etiology of acquired SAA is not understood but is likely related to abnormal immune responses and environmental exposures. We conducted a genome-wide association study of individuals with SAA genetically matched to healthy controls in discovery (359 cases, 1,396 controls) and validation sets (175 cases, 1,059 controls). Combined analyses identified linked SNPs in distinct blocks within the major histocompatibility complex on 6p21. The top SNP encodes p.Met76Val in the P4 binding pocket of the HLA class II gene HLA-DPB1 (rs1042151A>G, odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-2.03, p = 1.94 x 10(-13)) and was associated with HLA-DP cell surface expression in healthy individuals (p = 2.04 x 10(-6)). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Val76 is not monophyletic and likely occurs in conjunction with different HLA-DP binding groove conformations. Imputation of HLA-DPB1 alleles revealed increased risk of SAA associated with Val76-encoding alleles DPB1( *)03:01, (OR 1.66, p = 1.52 x 10(-7)), DPB1( *)10:01 (OR 2.12, p = 0.0003), and DPB1( *)01:01 (OR 1.60, p = 0.0008). A second SNP near HLA-B, rs28367832G>A, reached genome-wide significance (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.78, p = 7.27 x 10(-9)) in combined analyses; the association remained significant after excluding cases with clonal copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity affecting class I HLA genes (8.6% of cases and 0% of controls). SNPs in the HLA class II gene HLA-DPB1 and possibly class I (HLA-B) are associated with SAA. The replacement of Met76 to Val76 in certain HLA-DPB1 alleles might influence risk of SAA through mechanisms involving DP peptide binding specificity, expression, and/or other factors affecting DP function.},

   abstract = {MHC class II molecules are composed of one alpha-chain and one beta-chain whose membrane distal interface forms the peptide binding groove. Most of the existing knowledge on MHC class II molecules comes from the cis-encoded variants where the alpha- and beta-chain are encoded on the same chromosome. However, trans-encoded class II MHC molecules, where the alpha- and beta-chain are encoded on opposite chromosomes, can also be expressed. We have studied the trans-encoded class II HLA molecule DQ2.3 (DQA1*03:01/DQB1*02:01) that has received particular attention as it may explain the increased risk of certain individuals to type 1 diabetes. We report the x-ray crystal structure of this HLA molecule complexed with a gluten epitope at 3.05 A resolution. The gluten epitope, which is the only known HLA-DQ2.3-restricted epitope, is preferentially recognized in the context of the DQ2.3 molecule by T-cell clones of a DQ8/DQ2.5 heterozygous celiac disease patient. This preferential recognition can be explained by improved HLA binding as the epitope combines the peptide-binding motif of DQ2.5 (negative charge at P4) and DQ8 (negative charge at P1). The analysis of the structure of DQ2.3 together with all other available DQ crystal structures and sequences led us to categorize DQA1 and DQB1 genes into two groups where any alpha-chain and beta-chain belonging to the same group are expected to form a stable heterodimer.},

   abstract = {Vaccines for infectious diseases have improved the life of the human species in a tremendous manner. The principle of vaccination is to establish de novo adaptive immune response consisting of antibody and T cell responses against pathogens which should defend the vaccinated person against future challenge with the culprit pathogen. The situation is completely different for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergy, an immunologically-mediated hypersensitivity which is already characterized by increased IgE antibody levels and T cell responses against per se innocuous antigens (i.e., allergens). Thus, allergic patients suffer from a deviated hyper-immunity against allergens leading to inflammation upon allergen contact. Paradoxically, vaccination with allergens, termed allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT), induces a counter immune response based on the production of high levels of allergen-specific IgG antibodies and alterations of the adaptive cellular response, which reduce allergen-induced symptoms of allergic inflammation. AIT was even shown to prevent the progression of mild to severe forms of allergy. Consequently, AIT can be considered as a form of therapeutic vaccination. In this article we describe a strategy and possible road map for the use of an AIT approach for prophylactic vaccination against allergy which is based on new molecular allergy vaccines. This road map includes the use of AIT for secondary preventive vaccination to stop the progression of clinically silent allergic sensitization toward symptomatic allergy and ultimately the prevention of allergic sensitization by maternal vaccination and/or early primary preventive vaccination of children. Prophylactic allergy vaccination with molecular allergy vaccines may allow halting the allergy epidemics affecting almost 30% of the population as it has been achieved for vaccination against infectious diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) includes Graves disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), which partially share immunological features. Determining the genetic basis that distinguishes GD and HT is a key to understanding the differences between these 2 related diseases. AIM: The aims of this study were to identify HLA antigens that can explain the immunopathological difference between GD and HT and to elucidate epistatic interactions between protective and susceptible HLA alleles, which can delineate the distinct function of HLA in AITD etiology. DESIGN: We genotyped 991 patients with AITD (547 patients with GD and 444 patients with HT) and 481 control subjects at the HLA-A, HLA-C, HLA-B, DRB1, DQB1, and DPB1 loci. A direct comparison of HLA antigen frequencies between GD and HT was performed. We further analyzed an epistatic interaction between the susceptible and protective HLA alleles in the development of GD and HT. RESULTS: We identified 4 and 2 susceptible HLA molecules primarily associated with GD and HT, respectively, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*46:01, HLA-DRB1*14:03, and HLA-DPB1*05:01 for GD and HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-DRB4 for HT. In a direct comparison between GD and HT, we identified GD-specific susceptible class II molecules, HLA-DP5 (HLA-DPB1*05:01; Pc = 1.0 x 10(-9)) and HLA-DR14 (HLA-DRB*14:03; Pc = .0018). In contrast, HLA components on 3 common haplotypes in Japanese showed significant protective effects against the development of GD and HT (HLA-A*24:02-C*12:02-B*52:01-DRB1*15:02-DQB1*06:01-DPB1*09:01 and HLA-A*24:02-C*07:02-B*07:02-DRB1*01:01-DQB1*05:01-DPB1*04:02 haplotypes for GD and HLA-A*33:03-C*14:03-B*44:03-DRB1*13:02-DQB1*06:04-DPB1*04:01 haplotype for GD and HT). Interestingly, the representative protective HLA, HLA-DR13 (HLA-DRB1*13:02), was epistatic to susceptible HLA-DP5 in controlling the development of GD. CONCLUSION: We show that HLA exerts a dual function, susceptibility and resistance, in controlling the development of GD and HT. We also show that the protective HLA allele is partially epistatic to the susceptible HLA allele in GD.},

   abstract = {Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergy is the most common immune disorder. More than 30% of the population suffer from symptoms of allergy which are often severe, disabling, and life threatening such as asthma and anaphylaxis. Population-based birth cohort studies show that up to 60% of the world population exhibit IgE sensitization to allergens, of which most are protein antigens. Thirty years ago the first allergen-encoding cDNAs have been isolated. In the meantime, the structures of most of the allergens relevant for disease in humans have been solved. Here we provide an update regarding what has been learned through the use of defined allergen molecules (i.e., molecular allergology) and about mechanisms of allergic disease in humans. We focus on new insights gained regarding the process of sensitization to allergens, allergen-specific secondary immune responses, and mechanisms underlying allergic inflammation and discuss open questions. We then show how molecular forms of diagnosis and specific immunotherapy are currently revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment of allergic patients and how allergen-specific approaches may be used for the preventive eradication of allergy.},

Association studies between HLA and asthma were first reported in the 1970s, and yet, the precise role of HLA alleles in asthma is not fully understood.

   abstract = {Purpose: Classical alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex have been linked to specific entities of pediatric noninfectious uveitis, yet genetic predisposition encoded by the HLA super-locus across the patient population remains understudied. Methods: We performed next-generation full-length sequencing of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1 in 280 cases. Dense genotype data from 499 Dutch controls from Genome of the Netherlands were imputed using an HLA-specific reference panel (n = 5225 samples from European ancestry). Cases and controls were compared using logistic regression models adjusting for sex. Results: In total, 179 common and rare alleles were detected. Considering all cases and controls, HLA-DQB1*04:02 and HLA-DRB1*08:01 were identified as the principal HLA association, which was mainly driven by 92 cases with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-U). The HLA-DQB1*04:02-HLA-DRB1*08:01 haplotype was also the primary association for the phenotypically similar idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis without arthritis (CAU). Also, HLA-DQB1*05:03 was an independent risk allele for CAU, but not in JIA-U. Analysis of 185 cases with other forms of uveitis revealed HLA-wide associations (P < 2.79 x 10-4) for HLA-DRB1*01:02, HLA-DRB1*04:03, and HLA-DQB1*05:03, which could be primarily attributed to cases with panuveitis. Finally, amino acid substitution modeling revealed that aspartic acid at position 57 that distinguishes the risk allele HLA-DQB1*05:03 (for CAU and panuveitis) from nonrisk alleles, significantly increased the binding capacity of naturally presented ligands to HLA-DQ. Conclusions: These results uncovered novel shared HLA associations among clinically distinct phenotypes of pediatric uveitis and highlight genetic predisposition affecting the antigen presentation pathway.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND The relationship between HLA-DRB1 alleles and asthma is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between HLA-DRB1 alleles and risk of asthma. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang (Chinese) database, and Chinese Biomedical Medical databases (CBM) to find studies on the relationship between HLA-DRB1 alleles and risk of asthma. We calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using STATA 12.0. Finally, a total of 24 studies were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS The results revealed that DRB1*03 was positively associated with risk of asthma (OR=1.51, 95%CI=1.27-1.80), and DRB1*15 was negatively associated with risk of asthma (OR=0.63, 95%CI=0.42-0.93), but no association was found in other HLA-DRB1 alleles. Subgroup analysis by age revealed that DRB1*03, DRB1*04, DRB1*09, and DRB1*15 were associated with asthma in children. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that DRB1*03 and DRB1*15 were associated with asthma in whites, and DRB1*07 and DRB1*14 were associated with asthma in Asians. CONCLUSIONS This results of this meta-analysis suggest that HLA-DRB1 alleles are associated with asthma.},

   abstract = {Identification of the primary allele(s) in HLA class II associated diseases remains challenging because of a tight linkage between alleles of HLA-DR and -DQ loci. In the present study, we determined the genotypes of seven HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1 and -DPB1) for 1200 Japanese patients with primary biliary cholangitis and 1196 controls. Observation of recombination derivatives facilitated an evaluation of the effects of individual HLA alleles consisting of disease-prone/disease-resistant HLA haplotypes. Consequently, a primary contribution of DQB1*06:04 (odds ratio: 0.19, p = 1.91 x 10(-22)), DQB1*03:01 (odds ratio: 0.50, p = 6.76 x 10(-10)), DRB1*08:03 (odds ratio: 1.75, p = 1.01 x 10(-7)) and DQB1*04:01 (odds ratio: 1.50, p = 9.20 x 10(-6)) was suggested. Epistasis of the protective DQB1*06:04 to risk conferred by DRB1*08:03 was demonstrated by subpopulation analysis, implicating the presence of an active immunological mechanism that alleviates pathogenic autoimmune reactions. Further, the contribution of the aforementioned HLA alleles as well as an HLA-DP allele, DPB1*02:01 to the association signals of 304 loci among 4103 SNPs in the HLA region at the genome-wide level of significance (p values less than 5 x 10(-8)) was demonstrated by the stepwise exclusion of the individuals possessing these HLA alleles from the comparison.},

A possible excess of HLA-DR1 was found in subjects who were responsive to Fel d I compared with those who were not (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2, P = 0.002), and a possible excess of HLA-DR4 was found in subjects responsive to Alt a I (OR = 1.9, P = 0.006). Increased sharing of HLA-DR/DP haplotypes was seen in sibling pairs responding to both allergens. Der p I, Der p II, Phl p V and Can f I were not associated with any definite excess of HLA-DR alleles. No significant correlations were seen with HLA-DP genotype and reactivity to any of the allergens. The results suggest class II HLA restriction is insufficient to account for individual differences in reactivity to common allergens.},

Determining sensitization patterns assists clinicians in tailoring an efficient medical management. Objective: To determine the aeroallergen sensitization pattern and relationship to clinical parameters. Methods: A retrospective review of children (2-14-years) files with i) Pediatric Allergist/or Pulmonologist confirmed-diagnosis of A, and AR, and ii) positive skin prick test (SPT). Results: Among 473 patients (69.1% males; 30.9% females), aged 7.6 years, family history was positive in 66.3%: 59.4% in A, 64.2% AR, and 78.2% A-AR. The number of allergens/patients was 2.1+/-1.7. Median eosinophil count was 400 cells/ul and IgE 287 KU/L. Rates of A, AR, and A-AR varied significantly in children </=5 years compared to >10 years: A was 43.2% vs 17.8%, and AR 34.5% vs 16.4%. Two hundred and four children (43.1%) were mono-sensitized, 215 (45.5%) oligosensitized (2-3 allergens), and 54 (11.4%) polysensitized (>/=4 allergens). A-AR ranked the top number of positive allergens. The commonest aeroallergen was Der p1 (38.1%), followed by Der f (29.0%), cat (22.6%), alternaria (18.8%), American cockroach (18.4%), and dog (14.0%). House dust mite (HDM) and American cockroach were commoner in </=5 years than older >10-year children (52.5%, 24.1%), while cat and dog allergens were commoner in older ones (37.1%, 21.6%). Conclusion: Family history is quite positive in patients with A and AR. Common aeroallergens include HDM, cats, and alternaria in the young children, while animal allergens were commoner in the older children.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a multifactorial immunologic disease that is influenced by both genetic and environment factors. House dust mites (HDMs) are important inhalant aeroallergens and are an epidemiologic risk factor for AR. Similarly, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes DQB1 and DRB1 have been shown to be associated with AR and play an important role in the regulation of the immune response. The objective of this work was to elucidate the HLA-II gene alleles associated with AR in HDM-sensitive Han Chinese subjects. METHODS: A total of 142 patients with AR and 184 healthy subjects were recruited to this case-control study. Diagnosis of AR was based on medical history, laryngological examination, skin-prick tests, and HMD-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) assays. Genotyping of HLA-DRB1 and HAL-DQB1 was performed by the polymerase chain reaction sequence-based genotyping method. RESULTS: A total of 35 alleles of the HLA-DRB1 locus and 19 alleles of the HLA-DQB1 locus were genotyped in the entire study cohort; the frequencies of alleles DQB1*06:01:01 (corrected p value [pc ] = 0.009; odds ratio [OR] = 2.684; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.482 to 4.994) and DRB1*08:03:02 (pc = 0.009; OR = 3.754; 95% CI = 1.724 to 8.851) were significantly increased in HDM-sensitive AR patients compared to healthy controls and are considered to be a risk factor for AR in Chinese Han subjects. The frequency of haplotype DRB1*08:03-DQB1*06:01 in the HDM-sensitive AR group was also significantly higher than in the control group (9.5% vs 2.4%; pc = 0.005; OR = 4.182; 95% CI = 1.870 to 10.285). Serological antigen types assessment further demonstrated the frequency of HLA-DRB1*08 (pc = 0.022; OR = 2.982; 95% CI = 1.46 to 6.400) to be significantly increased in HDM-sensitive AR patients, and the frequencies of DRB1*14 (pc = 0.030; OR = 0.340; 95% CI = 0.154 to 0.694) and DQB1*05 (pc = 0.030; OR = 0.459; 95% CI = 0.269 to 0.764) to be significantly decreased, compared to healthy controls, suggesting that HLA-DRB1*08 might be a risk factor, and DRB1*14 and DQB1*05 protective factors for HDM-sensitive AR. CONCLUSION: HLA-DRB1*08:03:02 and HLA-DQB1*06:01:01 are associated with HMD-sensitive AR and may confer a risk for development of AR in Han Chinese subjects sensitized to HDM.},
